# UFOs - ****Please see UFO Challenge Summary document****
Project Overview
Pictures are worth a thousand words.  Data visualizations helps the website developer to report data that is clear, accessible, and unified. 
JavaScript is a coding language designed to upgrade webpages by enhancing the users involvement. Javascript enhances websites by providing front-end functionality, customization, dashboards (such as maps or graphs), and allows for user input to create dynamic web pages. 
In this repository, I used Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. 

Coding Goals
Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
Create a Javascript array into an HTML Table.
Project Deliverables
Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
Results
The webpage is somewhat user-friendly display of data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on various criteria such as date, city, state, and shape of the UFO sighting
 
In the picture below you can see an area to update field entries.  In my example, I entered "El Paso" as the default city as this is my home.The displayed results are filtered for the user as the field entries are updated. 
 
Summary
The postivies are that the webpage allows users to search multiple criteria at one time and there is no submit button needed. The negatives of the webpage the search options are limited. In addition, the filter  is case sensitive; this can affect the results from user input.  I think, in the future, it is recommended to remove case-sensitivity in all the textbox search fields.  I would also like to see a add a drop down menu for the Shape field.
